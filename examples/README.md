# kvzRTP example codes

This directory contains directories full and simple. Simple directory contains code snippets that demonstrate how the library should be used. These miminal examples also show how the library can be used, but don't themselves do anything.

Full directory on the other hand shows the complete flow: these snippts encode HEVC/Opus from raw video, send this encoded data using the library and receive and reconstruct the received frames.
These code snippets contain a lot of code unrelated to kvzRTP.

You can also use [Kvazzup](https://github.com/ultravideo/Kvazzup) to see a real-world example.
